# http-cgi-server
Primitive HTTP server with simple support for CGI scripts. Just enough for something static like it's 1992.

Can be compiled with any C++ compiler that supports C++17. Uses `meson` for building.
Simple scripts for compilation and execution are `build.sh` and `run.sh` are located in
the root directory.

All server resources should be stored in `www/` subdirectory.

## Building
> build.sh

## Starting
> run.sh

or 

> cd www/; ../path/to/server-executable
